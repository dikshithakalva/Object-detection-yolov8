This project focuses on using YOLOv8, a cutting-edge object detection model, to automatically identify football players in images and videos.
We'll train a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset of football footage, enabling it to recognize players on the field. This has the potential to unlock various applications, including:

Automated analysis of player movement and positioning for tactical breakdowns.
Real-time player tracking for enhanced viewing experiences during broadcasts.
Automatic player identification in video archives or for creating heatmaps of player activity.
